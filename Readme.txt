# NOTE: You need to have Windows .NET SDK Installed. I am using v 10.0 downloaded here:

# https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet

# At the top level run:

dotnet build -c Release

# Then double click the .exe in the bin/Release folder to run
# Or you can run it on the command line:

./bin/Release/net10.0-windows/DND_SoundBoard.exe
